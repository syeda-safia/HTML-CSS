   Paragraph elements is used to display the given text through a paragraph on the website.we use letter "p" to consider that this is a paragraph element.

   Button element diplay it as a shape of button on the website.we use the whole word "button"to consider that it is a button element.then it displays as a button.

   Anchor element is used when we have to make a link.In anchor element there are two types of attriputes They are:
    1.HTML attripute name
    2. attripute value

    HTML attripute name is nothing but whatever after the open tag and before the = to which means "href" is called attripute name
